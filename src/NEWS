* Major changes in ekiga 3.3.0 (2010-12-21)
** Distributor-specific changes
- New pulse audio plugin (in ptlib)
- ekiga is now split between one executable, one library and two
  plugins (evolution and ldap).  This means that evolution-data-server
  for ex. can be used during building, but is not mandatory upon
  execution: if it exists, ekiga will use it, if not it just does not
  use it :o)  As a consequence, this allows to install ekiga without
  e-d-s and its many dependencies (see
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=520830 for ex.)
- Some dependencies versions have been raised, configure checks them
- Depend on boost instead of sigc++

  opal to get "noisy" command lines during compilation, and make V=1
  for ekiga
